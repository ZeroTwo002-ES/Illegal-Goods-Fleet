# Illegal-Goods-Fleet
Add some ship that carry illegal goods, which you can sell at good price, remember, this is illegal goods, mean you need to find planet with low, or no security at all, or use some interference plating.

This ship also have it own escort, that you need to take care too, making it more challenging to plunder.

I also make the government for the ship have same name as the merchant, add some difficulty in detecting the ship.

Don't worry, i make sure that the ship still can be found pretty easy, because 
the ship color will always be black colored, so more easy to detect.

I make each fleet have it's own government, so only same fleet ship that will get angry (making it more easier for low tier ship user to earn money, and not dying because sudden larger illegal fleet jump into the system).

Don't worry about angry illegal goods carrier ship, they will be back like nothing is happen, when one day is pass (either go jump to other system, or land on planet, do what you like).
